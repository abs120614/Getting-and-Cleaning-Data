Getting and Cleaning Data 
Course Project 2

Overview of Project

The main pupose of this project is to demonstarte collection, working with and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used in subsequent analysis. A data for this project can be found here:

What to find in the repository
The following should be there in the repository created for this project:

1. CodeBook.md: Information about variables, the data and any transformation performed to clean up the data
2. README.md: Explanation on how all the scripts work and they are connected.
3. run_analysis.R: The R script that has the code to clean up the data and present in a tidy data set.

Poject Summary
 The following is a summary of what the project required us to do.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information
The CodeBook.md has the additional information on the variables, the data and the transformations that were done to get to final objective of the assignment, creating the tidy data set.
